      <p><b>Meet <span>Mohd. Mujahid Khan</span> - The proud owner of Livasa Naturals.</b></p>
      <p>Hailing from Hapur, Uttar Pradesh where all the extraction and processing of honey happens, I developed my interest in Bee-Farming at the age of 25. Then, I started reading many books and started visiting different exhibitions & Trade shows, This Sparked a Passion inside me to take and learn the Bee-keeping. I enrolled for Bee keeping classes and almost Devoted around 10 Years of My Life to start the Bee-Keeping and Honey Collecting Business. This Learning of more than 10 Years helped me to understand the whole process of Bee-Farming to Produce & Procure Natural Honey from the lap of nature. My curiosity to know more started increasing day by day and eventually I decided to opt it as my career.</p>
      <p>With eyes full of hope, I started my own bee farming business in 2000 with 4 colony bee hives. Like any startup, the journey was full of ups and downs, but nothing wavered me off from my goal. Today, with grace of God, I am owning 2200 bee hive colonies and expanding even more. Livasa Naturals has also earned a great reputation in the market for its unparalleled, unfiltered and unprocessed products like  vinegar,  saffron and shilajit power packed with nutrients.</p>
      <p>I am extremely privileged to have the opportunity to positively impact each of my customer’s lives by helping them and their families opt for healthy products for a better future.
